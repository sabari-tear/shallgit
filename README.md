# shallgit

A simple version control system inspired by Git, written in C++. It provides basic version control features such as initializing a repository, adding files, committing changes, branching, merging, and moreâ€”all from the command line.

---

## Features
- Initialize a new repository
- Add and remove files
- Commit changes
- View commit logs and global logs
- Branching and merging
- File and branch checkout
- Status reporting

---

## Dependencies
- **C++17** or later
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (for serialization)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (for SHA-1 hashing)

> **Note:** This project is designed for Windows and uses Visual Studio project files.

---

## Building the Project

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) and [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) libraries on your system.
   - Make sure they are discoverable by Visual Studio (set up include/lib paths if needed).

2. **Open the Solution:**
   - Open `shallgit.sln` in Visual Studio 2019 or later.

3. **Build:**
   - Select the desired configuration (Debug/Release, x64/x86).
   - Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B).

4. **Run:**
   - The executable will be located in `x64/Release/` or `x64/Debug/` depending on your build configuration.

## Usage

All commands are run from the command line in your project directory:

```sh
shallgit <command> [arguments]
```

### Typical Workflow

```sh
# Initialize a new repository
shallgit init

# Add a file to the staging area
shallgit add myfile.txt

# Commit staged changes
shallgit commit "Initial commit"

# View commit log
shallgit log

# Create a new branch
shallgit branch feature-x

# Switch to a branch
shallgit checkout feature-x

# Merge a branch into the current branch
shallgit merge feature-x

# Remove a file
shallgit rm myfile.txt

# View status
shallgit status
```
